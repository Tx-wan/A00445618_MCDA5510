My name is Taixuan Wan. You can also call me Ted. I am from China. I have worked for SONY as software developer and quality engineer for 3 years. Then I worked for CieNET as software engineer and IT engineer in next 5 years. In my time, travelling is my favourite.  My preferred email is tt_monkey0331@hotmail.com. My A# number is A00445618.

In this course, the latest theories about software development in modern business environment are the topics I want to see most, because They might give me more insight thoughts about the job which I have worked for some years. I hope that it can bring something which I can hardly learn from the daily jobs, 

I have more than 3 years working experience of JAVA and 2-year working experience of VB.
